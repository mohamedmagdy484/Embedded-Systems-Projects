ðŸš€ RTC System Project | ITI Summer Internship â€“ Embedded Systems Track
As part of the Embedded Systems Summer Internship Information Technology Institute (ITI) , we developed a Real-Time Clock (RTC) system using AVR (ATmega32) and the DS1307 module, programmed entirely in Embedded C.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
Real-time clock display in both 24-hour and 12-hour (AM/PM) formats
Display of full calendar date (day, month, year)
Manual time and date setting via intuitive UI
Alarm system with time-remaining display and buzzer alert
Stopwatch mode featuring Start, Pause/Resume, and Reset, with an optional buzzer every minute
Countdown timer with full control over duration and operation
Efficient UI navigation using only 5 push buttons, supported by LED indicators and on-screen messages

ðŸŽ¯ Technologies & Skills:
I2C communication with DS1307 RTC
State machineâ€“based menu navigation
LCD, buzzer, and LED control
Smart button-based user interface design
